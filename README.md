# CSV-Name-Duplicate-Check
This code consists of a Example CSV file (Comma-separated values) and code which recognizes duplicates within the strings.

"Names.csv", the file which witholds the thousand names, has some same duplicates. The code I created named "NameDupeCheck.py" will detect the top 20 similar names, and 100% twin strings.

This code is useful to find duplicates in data.
